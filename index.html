        <p>
            The Nine-Tailed Fox, also known as Kurama, is one of the nine tailed beasts in the Naruto universe. It is a powerful and ancient being that was sealed into Naruto Uzumaki, the main protagonist of the series, when he was just a baby.
         According to the search results, Kurama was once a mindless monster and was sought after as a tool for war, which caused it to hate humans. However, after being sealed into Naruto, Kurama’s perspective changed, and it began to see Naruto as a son and a friend. Naruto’s kind and respectful treatment of Kurama helped to break down the fox’s cynical outlook on the world, and it eventually came to use its power for the world’s salvation
